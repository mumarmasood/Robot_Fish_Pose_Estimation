# 2D Pose Estimation for Robot Fish

This project is about estimating the 2D pose of a robot fish. The pose is defined by the position (x, y) and orientation (theta) of the fish.

## Features

- Real-time video stream processing to track the fish.
- Pose estimation using computer vision techniques.
- Display of the current fish position and orientation.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. List of the dependencies is as follows
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Install NumPy: `pip install numpy`
- Install Matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib`
2. Run the script `2D_Pose_Estimation_v1.py`.

## Code Structure

- `video_stream()`: This function captures the video stream and processes each frame to track the fish.
- `update_fish_position()`: This function updates the global variables `fish_x`, `fish_y`, and `fish_theta` with the current position and orientation of the fish.

## Notes

- The fish position and orientation are displayed in the console.
- The position and orientation are also stored in global variables `fish_x`, `fish_y`, and `fish_theta`.

## Future Work

- Improve the accuracy of the pose estimation.
- Add more features such as tracking multiple fish simultaneously.
